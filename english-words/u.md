### Synonyms & Antonyms

| Category | Synonyms | Antonyms |

| **Direct/General** | Suspicion, Mistrust | Trust, Confidence |
| **Psychological** | Delusion, Obsession | Sanity, Rationality |
| **Informal** | The "creeps," Edgy | Carefree, Naivety |

### The "Don't Mix Up" Section: Paranoia vs. Prudence

* **Paranoia** is irrational. It creates a "conspiracy" where there isn't one. If you think the mailman is reading your letters because he's a spy, that's **paranoia**.
* **Prudence** (or Caution) is rational. It is based on evidence. If you lock your door because there have been burglaries in the neighborhood, that's **prudence**.

> **The Vibe:** Paranoia feels heavy and isolating; it's a fear that locks you inside your own head.

## 6. Memory Anchor

* **Mnemonic:** Focus on the prefix **Para-**. Just as a **Para**chute stays *beside* or *above* you, **Para**noia is a thought that sits *beside* reality—it looks like the real world, but it’s slightly "off."
* **Logical Association:** Since it means "beyond the mind," think of it as your imagination running **beyond** what your eyes actually see.

Would you like me to generate a short practice exercise to help you distinguish between "unassailable" and its synonyms in context?
