* **Paranoia** is irrational. It creates a "conspiracy" where there isn't one. If you think the mailman is reading your letters because he's a spy, that's **paranoia**.
* **Prudence** (or Caution) is rational. It is based on evidence. If you lock your door because there have been burglaries in the neighborhood, that's **prudence**.
