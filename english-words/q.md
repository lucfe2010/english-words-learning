| Word | vs. **Quinine** | The Critical Difference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chloroquine** | Synthetic vs. Natural | Chloroquine is a synthetic drug *modeled* after quinine; it is generally more potent and less toxic. |
| **Quinidine** | Isomer | Quinidine has an identical formula but different shape; it is used mainly for **heart arrhythmias**, not malaria. |
| **Tonic Water** | Product vs. Ingredient | Tonic water contains only trace amounts of quinine—not enough to treat an active malaria infection. |

* **Common Learner Error:** Mispronunciation. British English users typically say **/ˈkwɪn.iːn/** (KWIN-een), while American English users often say **/ˈkwaɪ.naɪn/** (KWAY-nine). Confusing these can lead to misunderstandings in international medical contexts.
* **Technical Fact:** Quinine is highly **fluorescent**. If you shine a UV light (blacklight) on a glass of tonic water, the quinine will glow a bright, ghostly blue.
