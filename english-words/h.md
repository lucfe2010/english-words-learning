* **Word Family:** * **Hedgerow** (Noun: a line of hedges)
* **Hedging** (Noun/Gerund: the act of avoiding a direct statement)

## 5. Nuance & Distinction

### Synonyms & Antonyms

* **Figurative Synonyms:** Insure (protect), evade (avoiding a question), equivocate (using ambiguous language).
* **Antonyms:** Confront (face directly), risk (take a chance), expose (leave unprotected).

### The "Don't Mix Up" Section: Hedge vs. Dodge

While both involve "avoidance," the **vibe** is different:

* **Dodge:** This is an active, physical, or quick escape. You *dodge* a bullet or *dodge* a specific question by changing the subject entirely.
* **Hedge:** This is more about **softening** or **balancing**. When you *hedge*, you don't run away; you just provide a "padded" answer (e.g., "I'm fairly certain, but I might be wrong") to protect yourself from being proven wrong later.

## 6. Memory Anchor

### Mnemonic

Think of a **Hedge** as a **"Safety Bush."** * **Literal:** You hide behind a bush for protection.

* **Financial:** You hide your money behind "protective bushes" (different investments) so the wind (market crash) can't hit it all at once.
* **Social:** You hide your true opinion behind "vague bushes" so no one can attack you for being wrong.

### Logical Association

The word makes sense because a literal hedge is a **flexible boundary**. Unlike a stone wall, it’s soft and made of many small branches. This mirrors the figurative meaning: instead of a "hard" yes or no, you provide a "soft" boundary of words to keep your options open.
