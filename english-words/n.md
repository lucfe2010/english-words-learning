---

### The "Don't Mix Up" Section: Nuance vs. Difference

* **Difference:** Can be huge. The difference between a cat and a car is obvious.
* **Nuance:** Is always small. The **nuance** between "angry" and "furious" is the level of intensity.

> **Vibe Check:** If you can see the change from a mile away, it’s a **difference**. If you have to lean in and pay close attention to see it, it’s a **nuance**.

## 6. Memory Anchor

* **Mnemonic:** Think of a **New Ants** colony. To a stranger, all the ants look the same. But if you look closely at the **new ants**, you see tiny **nuances** in how they move or look.
* **Logical Association:** Think of the **"cloud"** origin. Clouds don't have hard edges; they blend into one another. **Nuance** is where one meaning blends into the next.

* **The "Don't Mix Up" Section: Nonetheless vs. Nevertheless**

* **The "Vibe":** Both are more formal than "but" or "however." They signal to the reader that a sophisticated transition is coming.
